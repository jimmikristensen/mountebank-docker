# Mountebank
Mountebank is an out of process component testing tool for distributed software.

Mountebank is the first open source tool to provide cross-platform, multi-protocol test doubles over the wire. Simply point your application under test to mountebank instead of the real dependency, and test like you would with traditional stubs and mocks.

## jkris/mountebank:latest

Installs the latest version of mountebank and exposes port 2525 ready for
configuration and testing.

Run the following command to run the docker image:

    docker run -p 2525:2525 -d jkris/mountebank

This will start mountebank and expose port 2525, which is the default listening port.
Visit [localhost:2525](http://localhost:2525) for configuration and manual.

If you wish to load your imposters automatically, mount your imposters as a
volume and bind the necessary ports:

```
docker run \
    -v ./imposters:/imposters \
    [-p IMPOSTER_1_PORT:IMPOSTER_1_PORT ...] \
    -p 2525:2525 \
    -d jkris/mountebank \
    --configfile /imposters/imposters.ejs --allowInjection
```

## Docker Compose

This release comes with a docker compose example that uses a _Star Trek API_ imposter stub `stapi_imposter.ejs` generated using Mountebanks `proxyOnce` mode found in the `proxy_imposter.ejs` proxy imposter example.

The docker-compose.yml file looks like this:

```
version: "3"
services:
  mountebank:
    container_name: mountebank
    image: jkris/mountebank:latest
    volumes:
    - ./imposters:/imposters
    ports:
    - 2525:2525
    - 8090:8090
    command: --configfile /imposters/imposters.ejs --allowInjection
```

It mounts the volume containing the imposters `./imposters:/imposters` and uses the _root_ `imposters.ejs` as the config file.

Another imporatnt thing to remember is to open the correct ports. Port `2525` is for Mountebank management page. Because I have defined the imposter to use port `8090` I have opened that as well:

```
{
    "port": 8090,
    "protocol": "http",
    "stubs": [
    ...
```

### Try it out

Run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Then run the following to see the imposter in action.

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8090/api/v1/rest/series/search
```

### Hint

Try changing the `wait` behavior in the `stapi_imposter.ejs` file to increate the latency of the response.
